                            <p>Lesson 17: In this lesson, you will be introduced to your first (of very many) connecting particles in Korean. You can usually use these particles to separate two two ideas/phrases/sentences. In this lesson you will learn about 고 and how it can be used in sentences, also using the example of ~고 싶다. You will also learn that some words (usually position-like words) play by different rules than most verbs in these situations.</p>

                            <p>Lesson 18: In this lesson, you will continue learn applications for the particle ~고. Specifically, you will learn about how you can use ~고 있다 to mean “I am … ing.” You will also learn that you can’t use this with verbs of position (stand, sit, etc). In addition, you will learn about how to add 어/어지다 to adjectives to give them the meaning of “it gets (adjective)” to make sentences like “it got cold.” </p>

                            <p>Lesson 19: In this lesson, you will learn how to make comparative and superlative sentences in Korean. Using comparative sentences, you will learn how to make sentences like “I am more beautiful than you” or “he is faster than his brother.” Using superlative sentences, you will learn how to make sentences like “I am the most handsome person in the world.” In addition, we will take an in-depth look at the word 더, which is commonly used in comparative sentences.</p>

Nonetheless, everything will be explained to you very thoroughly!</p>

                            <p>Lesson 21: In this lesson, you will learn how to modify your sentences to ask questions in Korean. You will first learn how to do this without any ‘question’ words (Did you eat yesterday?), and then you will learn about how to apply words like “why,” “when,” “where” and “who” to make questions. This lesson is so long, I had to split it up into two sections. So, this lesson will continue into the next lesson, where you will learn more about how to ask questions.</p>

Specifically, you will learn how to ask questions using the following words: how, what, which and how many. Asking questions with “how many” is slightly more confusing than the rest, so we will spend some time showing you the different ways you can use that.</p>
